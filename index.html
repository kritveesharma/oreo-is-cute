<p>The pipevine swallowtail is a striking butterfly with deep blue iridescent wings. Itâ€™s known for its toxic properties, derived from the plants it feeds on as a caterpillar, particularly the pipevine plant. This toxicity makes it unappealing to predators, which is why other butterflies mimic its appearance to avoid being eaten.</p>
<p>are they poisonous to humans?</p>
<p>No, pipevine swallowtails aren't poisonous to humans. While their caterpillars consume toxic pipevine plants, making them distasteful and toxic to predators like birds, humans aren't at risk from handling them. However, it's still a good idea not to touch or disturb them unnecessarily, as their defensive chemicals could cause mild irritation in some cases.</p>
